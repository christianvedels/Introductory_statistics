### A few reading tips

You don't need to read statistics from A to Z. Start with a question and use the chapter to find the answer. First skim headings, figures, and examples so you know what the details are for, and pause at definitions. Can you explain them in your own words and give a small example?

When it gets difficult, pay extra attention. Your brain quickly finds "good reasons" to procrastinate, but resistance is often a sign that you are about to learn something new. Switch gears instead of giving up -- work through one example, draw a figure, or solve one problem all the way through. Finish with a quick self-test. Can you explain the main idea in 60 seconds without looking?

- **Read actively:** write 2-3 questions as you go and check whether the text actually answers them.
- **Stay focused in small blocks:** Repeating a cycle of 25 minutes of reading + 5 minutes of break works well. And often better than hours of unfocused reading.
- **Use ChatGPT (or similar) as a study buddy:** have it quiz you on a section or explain a definition.
