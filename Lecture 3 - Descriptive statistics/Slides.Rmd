# Today's lecture
.pull-left-wide[


### This time and last time: Basic tools

- Measures of position: What is typical? (Mean, median, etc.)
- Measures of variation: How 'uncertain' are we? (Variance, standard deviation, etc.)
- **Histograms & Box Plots**
- **Correlation**

# Definition: *Statistic*
> A *statistic* is a number which sumarises some data

Examples: Mean, median, variance, quantiles, etc. (t-value, Z-value, etc.)

# Summary statistics (measures of central tendency)
.pull-left[
- If you know statistics, you are good friends with
- The 'mean', 'median', 'mode' 

### The mean (The one whos always around)
- The *expected* value
- Add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are  
$mean(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i x$

### The median (The stable friend)
- The *middle* value of the distribution
- Line up all numbers and find the middle
$median(\mathbf{x}) = x_{(n+1)/2)}$ (and the average of two if there is no middle)
]

.pull-right[
### The mode (Weird but always makes sense)
- Of all the numbers, which is the most common?
- Does not make sense for continuous variables


*If we have time, I will illustrate how they work in relation to a histogram on the blackboard*

# Summary statistics (measures of spread)

.pull-left[
- The *variance*, *standard deviation*, *IQR*, *range*, and others are like the friends who keep things unpredictable and uncertain. 

### The variance (The unpredictable one)
- How far the numbers are from the center
- Take the average squared difference from the mean
$variance(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2$

### The standard deviation (The chill one)
- The *normalized* version of the variance, for when you want it in the same units as the original data
- Just take the square root of variance
$std(\mathbf{x}) = \sqrt{variance(\mathbf{x})}$

]

.pull-right[
### The IQR (The middle-ground friend)
- The range between the 25th and 75th percentiles 
- Shows the spread of the middle half of the data
$IQR = Q3 - Q1$

### The range (The overly enthusiastic one)
- The *wide-spanning* one â€“ the difference between the largest and smallest values
$range(\mathbf{x}) = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}$

## Some terminology: What is an expectation?
- The expectation is a *statistics* word for *mean* or *average*
- We might be able to compute the *mean* in a sample. 
- For the entire population, there will be an *Expecation* instead

- $\mathbb{E}(X)$ (or $E(x)$: The expectation of $X$
- Sometimes we use $\mu$, 'mu'
- If we have 723 observations of $x$: 221, 23, 63, 21, ... then we can *estimate* $\mathbb{E}(X)$ with the simple average:
  + $\mathbb{E}(X) \approx \frac{1}{N}(221 + 23 + 63 + 21, ...)$ *or simply*
  + $\mathbb{E}(X) \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N(x)$
  
- (.small123[We can also compute expectations in other ways, but that is not important yet.])

## Variance
- The *expectation* $\mathbb{E}(X)$ answers what the central tendency is. But what is the spread? (Will be important!)
- One answer: *Variance*, $\sigma^2_X$ or $Var(X)$ 
- Answers:
  + What is the *expected* squared deviation from the *expecation*
  
- Formula: $Var(X) = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}(X))^2]$
- Or: $Var(X) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} (x_i-\mu)^2$
  + Where $\mu$ is the expectation of X

## Definition: *Correlation* 
> Correlation is the degree to which two (or more things) are connected. *Typically* measured by the *correlation coefficient*


---
class: middle

.pull-left-wide[
> *Covariance* is a measure of how two variable co-varies. I.e. is there a tendency that Y increases when X increases? Or is it the other way around? Is there no relationship. *Measured in arbitrary units*.

### Formula: $\sigma_{XY} = cov(X,Y) = $

## Definition: *Correlation coefficient* 
> The *correlation coefficient* measures a simple linear relationship between the data, 

### Formula: $\rho_{X,Y} = corr(X, Y) =

# Current research 
.pull-left-wide[
- If you think it is helpful, I would like to say something related to the topic in my own research every time.
- Let's see how it works and let me know if you think it is a waste.
- The idea is to show you how it has importance to knowledge creation.
- (...and the research pipeline is long before you otherwise see it)

# Railways
.pull-left[
- I am working on railways
- We are trying to understand how important *market access* is for (softer) economic development
- E.g. the spread of 'modern ideas'.
- We could not understand our results before we produced summary statistics

# Before next time
.pull-left[
- You will have exercises on this
- Please see what you can solve - and challenge your *fluency heurestic* (find your weak spots)
- Remember: Everything is not covered in detail
- Next time: More summary statistics

- Exercises for the next week covers two lectures.
