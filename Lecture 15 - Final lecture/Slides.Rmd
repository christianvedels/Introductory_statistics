# A definition
> Statistics is about quantifying what we **know** and what we **don't know** based on some analysis of some data.


.footnote[
.small123[
**Note:** In practice this is as much philosophy as it is maths. And increasingly computer science is also involved. In practice innovations come as much from every field that uses it: Social Science, Biology, Economics, Psychology, Business Studies, etc.

# What is statistics and why do we need it?

---
class: middle
# TL;DR (From first lecture)

**Q:** What is it we do at a university?  
**A:** Part of the purpose of your education is to teach you tools to enable you to obtain new knowledge, scientifically and independently

**Q:** How do we obtain/create knowledge?  
**A:** One answer (out of many): Inherently we don't know anything. But we can limit our uncertainty by finding *empirical support that something is the case* $^1$

**Q:** Can we trust numbers?  
**A:** No. In general we can not trust numbers without knowing how they were estimated/calculated

**Q:** Why do we need statistics?  
**A:** In an uncertain world, statistics helps us make sense of complex information, quantify uncertainty, and draw evidence-based conclusions.

# How do we obtain/create knowledge?
### An analogy of doing social science with statistics 

> *"Studying societies and people is like standing in a dark room, throwing darts into empty space. If one hits something, we then argue endlessly over what was hit, what the dart really is, and whether we ever threw it in the first place."*

- Social science is *hard*

- Two paths forward:
  1. Drop the idea of learning anything specific: Everything is endlessly complex, and the only task is to appreciate this
  2. Cautious positivism: Pose certain ideas and then test them in data. Eventually we learn something. At least something which is (locally) useful.

*Statistics is often firmly in the second camp*

- It turns out that statistics is hard!

# How do we obtain/create knowledge?
.pull-left[
### How it is ought to be
*How we often assume it is in intro stats*
- You have some idea about how to measure something
- You collect data
- You test whether the data lends support to your idea
- You conclude or start over by collecting more data
]

.pull-right[
### How it often is
*The lived experience*
- You have some data
- You are asked to provide 'insights' 
- You start wondering about the type of questions you can answer
- You test these ideas 
- Your results are inconclusive
- Your boss demands that you make a conclusion anyway and move on to the next project. 
]

***Note:*** *In this course we will start in a nice and simplified world and then the complexity follows in further courses.*

# Can we trust numbers?
.pull-left-wide[
- Generally: No
- But there are degrees. 
- A strict statistical analysis can provide valuable insights.
- E.g. we can know whether painkillers work against headaches. 

- **Point of this course:** To introduce you to the basic theoretical framework to evaluate whether you can trust a number or not.

# A nice tool
.pull-left-wide[
- Draw arrows between things
- The arrows are the assumptions
- It would have prevented the ice cream problem - and many others
- Check: https://www.dagitty.net/dags.html#
- It tells you what to be aware of based on your assumptions

# Exam 
.pull-left-wide[
- An exam is a communications exercise.
  + If it is unclear to me, what you have done you might loose points
  + **Implication:** Highlight results, structure your response
- Strategy:
  + Start by solving the problems you can solve
- Formalities:
  + 4 hours
  + Open book - aids allowed - no communication
  + Paper to be handed in a pdf
