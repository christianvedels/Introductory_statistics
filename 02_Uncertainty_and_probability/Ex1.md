# Warm-up worked example: Sample space depends on what is recorded (new experiment)
**Use after slide 20, before slide 21**

## Problem
Two coin tosses happen.

Case 1: record the ordered result (H/T for each toss).  
Case 2: record only the number of heads.

Write the sample space $\Omega$ for each case.

---

## Worked solution
### Case 1 — ordered outcomes
Possible ordered pairs:
$\Omega_1 = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$

### Case 2 — number of heads
Possible counts:
- 0 heads (TT)
- 1 head (HT or TH)
- 2 heads (HH)

So:
$\Omega_2 = \{0, 1, 2\}$
