# Definition: *'Statistic'*

We now have the knowledge for an important modication of our definition from lecture 2:

> A statistic is a number which sumarises some data. 

#### Modification:
> In *statistics* (the discipline) want *statistics* (numbers) for which we know a theoretical distribution. This allows us to estimate the limits of our knowledge (uncertainty).

Examples: Mean, median, variance, quantiles, etc. (t-value, Z-value, F-statistic)

# 1. What is ANOVA? Setting Up Assumptions
- **Purpose:** Compare $p$ groups for equal means.
- **Examples:**
  + Sales performance in different regions.
  + Comparing yearly unemployment figures.
- **Why "Analysis of Variance"?**
  + Although testing for equal means, the variance plays a central role.
- **Assumptions:**
  1. **Homogeneity of Variance**  
     $$\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \cdots = \sigma_p^2$$
  2. **Normality:** Each group is normally distributed.
  3. **Independence:** Observations are independent.

# The Statistical Insight of ANOVA

.pull-left-wide[
### What is the Key Idea?

> ANOVA decomposes the overall variation in the data into components due to differences between groups and random variation within groups.

$$\text{Total Variation (SST)} = \text{Between Groups Variation (SSTR)} + \text{Within Groups Variation (SSE)}$$
]

---
# In a nutshell
.pull-left[
- **Between Groups:**  
  Measures how much the group means differ from the overall (grand) mean.  
  (Signal: Effects of treatments or conditions)

- **Within Groups:**  
  Captures the variability inside each group due to random chance or inherent noise.  
  (Noise: Natural, uncontrolled variability)

- When the **signal** exceeds the **noise**, we conclude that at least one group mean is significantly different.

# 2. One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) – Theory
- **Objective:** Test the hypothesis  
  $$H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=\dots=\mu_p \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \text{at least one } \mu_i \text{ is different}$$
- **Data Structure:**
  + Each group $i$ has $n_i$ observations.
  + Total observations: $$n = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_p$$
- **Two Sources of Variation:**
  - **Between Groups (Treatment):** Variation due to differences among group means.
  - **Within Groups (Error):** Variation within each group.

# Example: Impact of Trade War Tariffs on Import Prices (1/2)

.pull-left[
Imagine that due to the ongoing trade war, import prices for different product categories have increased. We don't know if three goods have been affected equally or it is just random fluctuations:

- **Consumer Electronics (Group A):**  
  $n_1 = 10$, average price increase $\bar{x}_1 = 5\%$
  
- **Industrial Equipment (Group B):**  
  $n_2 = 10$, average price increase $\bar{x}_2 = 10\%$
  
- **Agricultural Products (Group C):**  
  $n_3 = 10$, average price increase $\bar{x}_3 = 15\%$
  
**Overall Mean Price Increase:**

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{10\cdot 5 + 10\cdot 10 + 10\cdot 15}{30} =  10\%
$$
]

.pull-right[


**Between Groups (Treatment) Sum of Squares:**

$$
\text{SSTR} = 10(5-10)^2 + 10(10-10)^2 + 10(15-10)^2 
$$
$$
\text{SSTR} =  500
$$

**Within Groups (Error) Sum of Squares:**

Assume that within each product category, due to random factors (like market fluctuations or measurement error), the average squared deviation is $4$. Then for each group:

$$
\text{SSE}_{\text{group}} = (10-1)\cdot 4 = 9 \times 4 = 36
$$

Thus, the total within-group sum of squares is:

$$
\text{SSE} = 36 + 36 + 36 = 108
$$

# Example: Impact of Trade War Tariffs on Import Prices (2/2)

.pull-left[
**Degrees of Freedom:**

- **Total:** $n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29$
- **Between Groups:** $p - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$
- **Within Groups:** $n - p = 30 - 3 = 27$

**Mean Squares:**

$$
\text{MSR} = \frac{\text{SSTR}}{p-1} = \frac{500}{2} = 250
$$

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n-p} = \frac{108}{27} = 4
$$


]

.pull-right[
**F‑Statistic:**

$$
F = \frac{\text{MSR}}{\text{MSE}} = \frac{250}{4} = 62.5
$$

A high $F$-value of $62.5$ (p-value close to zero) indicates that the differences in import price increases among the three product categories are statistically significant. This suggests that the trade war tariffs are affecting these product categories differently.

# 3. Supplementary Analysis: Tukey Test & Confidence Intervals
- **Tukey Test:**
  + Performs pairwise comparisons between group means.
  + **Equal Sample Sizes:**
    $$T = q_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\text{MSE}}{n}}$$
  + **Unequal Sample Sizes:**  
    Use a modified formula based on the harmonic mean or the smallest sample size.
- **Confidence Intervals:**
  + For the difference between groups $i$ and $h$:
    $$(\bar{x}_i - \bar{x}_h) \pm t_{\alpha/2,\,n-p} \sqrt{\text{MSE}\left(\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_h}\right)}$$
  + No overlap between intervals indicates a significant difference.


---
class: middle

# 4. Violating the Assumptions of ANOVA
- **Issue:** Assumptions may not always be met.
- **What to do:**
  + **Homogeneity of Variance:**
    - Test with **Bartlett’s Test**:
      $$\chi^2 = \left(1 - c\right) \sum_{i=1}^{p}(n_i-1)\ln(s_i^2) - \ln\left( \frac{\text{SSE}}{n-p}\right)$$
      where $c$ is a correction factor.
  + **Non-Normal Data:**  
    Consider the non‑parametric **Kruskal‑Wallis test**.
  + **Other Diagnostics:**  
    Use the Bowman-Shenton test for normality.

# Example: Seasonality in Energy prices

.pull-left[
- Energy prices determine:
  + Cost of production
  + Poverty rates 
  + Politics
  + Endless other things ...

### Two empirical questions:
- Q1. Can we predict energy prices? 
  + Hard question: But yes, somewhat.
  
- Q2. Is there theoretical room for predicting energy prices? Are they systematic?
  + Easier question. Necesary if we hope to be able to address the first question
  + In other words: Is it reasonable to reject: $H_0: \; \text{Energy are random}$
  
- Goal: We will answer **Q2** with ANOVA

# Life on Mars?

.pull-left-wide[
- It is still unsettled whether there is life on Mars
- But in the early 20th century, some scientists, believed, they had evidence for **a civilisation of intelligent life on mars**
- It did appear so through unclear images in telescopes
- Humans are really good at finding patterns, even when there are none

# Electricity data

### Questions:
- Is it reasonable to assume that prices come from the same random distribution regarding:
  + Time of day?
  + Month of year?
  + Day of week?
  
- If we can reject this, there might be scope for some predictability

- [Data on hourly prices since 2022 is available here](https://github.com/christianvedels/Introductory_statistics/raw/refs/heads/main/Lecture%2010%20-%20ANOVA/Examples/Electricity_prices.xlsx)
